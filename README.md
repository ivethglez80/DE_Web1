<h1 align="center" id="title">Event invitation</h1>

<p id="description">A PERN stack-based SPA (PostgreSQL Express.js React Node.js) is crafted to efficiently manage CRUD operations.<br>The application streamlines event planning and enhances user interaction.<br>It features an inviting landing page with interactive buttons: one to add the event to your Google Calendar another to view the location on Google Maps and a button to access a gift option with banking details which are copied to the clipboard for easy transaction.<br>There's also a button directing to a view of the couple's selected gifts. If a guest selects a gift the system checks for their registration status linking the gift to their name registration.<br>Similarly confirming event attendance triggers an option to view and select gifts associating them with the user's response.<br>Administrators can log in via Auth0 to access a dashboard where they can view registered guests adjust attendance remove invitees and manage the gift list – modifying deleting or adding items and uploading photos from their computer all integrated into a PostgreSQL database.</p>
